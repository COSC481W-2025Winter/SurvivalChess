Setup Auto Linting on Save in VS Code
Ensure that your code adheres to our projects formatting guidelines. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Install ESLint Extension in VS Code
- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window
- In the search bar, type ESLint and click Install on the extension by Microsoft.

2. Install Project Dependencies
- Open a terminal in the project folder.
- Run the following command to install the new necessary dependenciess:
npm install
- This will install all the new dependencies listed in the package.json file, including ESLint and Prettier.

3. Configure VS Code for Auto Linting on Save
- Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
- Type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)" and press Enter to open your settings.json file.
- Add or update the following settings to enable auto linting and auto fixing on save:
,"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.enable": true,
  "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true

4. Verify Itâ€™s Working
- Open a JavaScript file with some linting issues (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect spacing, etc.).
- Make a small change to the file or save the file.
- ESLint will automatically fix any issues it can, and Prettier will format your code as per the configuration.

Your code will now be auto-formatted on save. While ESLint is helpful, it cannot automatically do everything. 
It is important to check for errors and fix anything left manually before commiting to GitHub
- To see any issues that ESLint can not fix automatically, run the following in the terminal:
npx eslint FILE_NAME.js
- You may now manually fix any issues left
